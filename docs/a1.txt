The following list is not to be considered cast in concrete- each  survivalist  should customize his or her own  kit  for  the  barest  minimum of supplies. Note that the first three items  are for  finding your way, the second three are for your  protection, and the last four are for emergencies. A MAP of the area you will be hiking, canoeing, or  camping should  be  detailed enough so that you can find  man-made  items 
like  trails,  unimproved roads, power lines, etc.,  and  natural features  such as rivers, streams, hills and other terrain  land
marks that will guide you.
