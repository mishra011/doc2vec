Doctors and scientists  are  always  telling us ways to live longer.Usually they involve a healthier diet  or lifestyle: that is, eating less fat and more vegetables and fruits, getting more  exercise,  or giving up smoking. We wholeheartedly endorse  these  rigorous and unpleasant methods of extending life, but our research  into  centuries  of  American folk wisdom has turned up 100 EASY ways of avoiding death  by observing a few simple rules in everyday situations. These beliefs come from all over this country   and  were  actually  collected  by  students  of folklore and anthropology.None of them were made up. Just remember:  if  you  fail  to observe these rules, we won't be responsible for the consequences! Don't take ashes out of the fireplace or wood stove between Christmas and New Year's Day.Never place a broom on a bed. Close umbrellas before bringing them into a house. Avoid sweeping after sundown. You mustn't wash clothes on New Year Day. Don't shake out a tablecloth after dark. Never wash a flag.
Don't turn a chair on one leg. Keep cats off piano keys.Don't hang a dishcloth on a doorknob. Sweeping under a sick person's bed will kill him or her.
Don't ever, ever rock an empty rocking chair. Never add-on to the back of your house. You mustn't cut a new window in an old house; the only way to
avoid fatal consequences is to toss your apron through the new window, and then jump through it yourself.Never drive a nail after sunset.
