Shock is a condition resulting from a depressed state of many vital body functions. It can threaten life even though the injuries or conditions that caused the depression may not otherwise be fatal. The body's vital functions are depressed when there is a loss of blood volume, a reduced rate of blood flow or an insufficient supply of oxygen. Injury-related shock, commonly referred to as traumatic shock,is decidedly different from electric shock, insulin shock, and other special forms of shock. The degrees of shock is increased by abnormal changes in body temperature, by poor resistance of the victim to stress, by pain, by rough handling and by delay in treatment.
