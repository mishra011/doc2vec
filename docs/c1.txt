The pound  die requires no press, but instead, uses a mallet.  It is somewhat lower in cost because you do not need to purchase a press, but it is much slower to  use and doesn't produce jacketed bullets.   It is ideal for swaging large  caliber lead bullets,  and is often selected by  replica  blackpowder  rifle shooters who wish to use an authentic reproduction of the earliest form of swaging die (from the 1890's). The  reloading  press system is economical since most  handloaders already own a suitable reloading press.  It is limited to smaller rifle calibers (from .257 to .224) and medium handgun calibers (from .357  to .25  ACP) because of the inherent weakness of the slotted  ram.   There are certain design restrictions imposed on this system by the press, so it  is  not ideal for special work or custom  calibers.   Corbin  makes standard  calibers and shapes only,  in this system.   The cost is thus kept low for the quality.  Speed is greater than the pound die but less than the other, special swaging systems. The  Corbin Mity Mite system uses a special horizontal  ram  press with more power than any reloading press built.  It is much faster than a  reloading press since it ejects the bullet automatically on the back stroke.   The dies for this system,  and the matching punches,  do  not interchange with the reloading press system.  They are made to fit into the RAM of the press,  instead of the press head.  Calibers from .14 to .458,  tubing  jackets  with walls of up to  .030-inch  thickness,  and weights up to 450 grains, can all be swaged with the Mity Mite.  Custom work is done in this system.
