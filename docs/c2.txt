MAKING THE LEAD CORES. The  two  main components that go into most bullets are  the  lead filling,  or core,  and the outer skin,  or jacket.   We'll talk  about jackets in the next chapter.  Right now, let's make some cores.There  are  two main sources for lead cores.   You can purchase  a spool  of lead wire in the proper diameter,  along with a core  cutter, and chop off accurately-measured lengths.  Corbin has lead wire in pure 175,000  grain spools (LW-25),  and the PCS-1 Precision Core Cutter  to cut  them.   The core cutter has an adjustable stop screw that  adjusts the amount of lead cut on each stroke of the tool.  The  second source is your own supply of scrap lead,  the same  as you might use for bullet casting.   Corbin makes a 4-cavity, adjustable weight core mould that mounts to the reloading bench.   You don't  have to  pick  it  up,  and there are no handles  required.   Four  pistons, precision  fitted  to four cylinders,  slide up and down to  eject  the cores.   The bottom position is set by a rest plate.   This steel plate rests on a pair of nuts, fastened to two threaded rods at either end of the mould.
