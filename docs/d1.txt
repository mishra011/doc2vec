ELECTRO MAGNETIC PULSES. Imagine a very bright flash in the sky! No one is hurt. But, your transistor radio stops playing, your car won't start, the telephone doesn't ring, lights stay off, and we find ourselves  in the stone age!. THE developement of modern high-tech semiconductor devices have paralleled unsettled relations between the nations of the world with resulting technological advances affecting the lives of  every citizen of North America.  Communications have been made faster, automobiles more fuel-efficient and maintenance-free, TV sets, video-tape   recorders, and virtually every other piece of electronics equipment have been improved by the advent of the semiconductor and its high-tech advancements.  The relationship between nuclear weapons and the recent electronics advances may seem unclear, but a nuclear attack on the North American continent could make that relationship glaringly apparent. ALL nuclear explosions produce electromagnetic pulses (EMP's) and the ensuing induced voltages and currents produce in conductors ( wires and cables ) are comparable in strength to the strongest of lightning bolts.  EMP's may reach 3 million volts and 10,000 amperes for a total of 30-billion watts of energy. The largest commercial radio stations in the U.S. and Canada radiate 50,000 watts, or approximately one-millionth that much power! The major difference between EMP's and lightning is that EMP's are induced simultaneously over an entire wide area, while lightning occurs at a single location.
