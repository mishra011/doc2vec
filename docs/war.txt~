 Many people have commented that they were not able to make a light enough bullet with a certain jacket. After I checked it out, I found that the problem was the style of bullet.  Most of the standard jackets make just about any weight you like, if you know how to make use of the punches and dies. The open tip core seating punch will push a  short lead  core as far into the jacket as you like.   Then the point forming die  will wrap the end of the jacket around the ogive,  and the  bullet can be as light as you wish.  
          The problem is with solid lead tip Keith style bullets.  They fill the  jacket,  and  then some.   Typical jackets  available  today  make maximum weights for the caliber with this sort of style.  The answer is to use the hollow point and cup base punches on the bullet first,  then follow with the Keith punch.   This lets you use a lot less lead, moves it  forward  so  it can form lead nose within the cavity of  the  Keith punch, and thus produces a very light bullet in a very long jacket.
          One last point about reloading press dies:   they are just as good as  any  other kind,  except that they are made to fill  the  need  for entry-level,  lower  cost  bullet-making.   Rather than cut corners  on quality,  we  decided long ago that the best approach was to limit  the styles,  calibers,  and options available to a managable, popular group and  then  make the equipment in longer runs,  without the  expense  of individual, custom work.
